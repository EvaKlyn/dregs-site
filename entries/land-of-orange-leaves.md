# Overview

The Land of Orange Leaves is a remote world, existing outside the reach of the megacorps and empires, for now. Plant life is orange instead of green here, and the climate is permanently mild due to the influence of the warm oceans surrounding the main landmass.

The population of the world is relatively small and heavily rural, focusing on subsistence farming and enjoying the idyllic landscape. To the East there's a large region of sand dunes where almost nobody lives, but is popular for off-road vehicle usage.

# Carpenter Party

There's a provisional government that plans to replace itself with something else, later. That plan has kind of fallen to the wayside with the Carpenter Party taking control.

The Carpenter Party is firmly in opposition to the use of magic and heavily isolationist: they want the Land of Orange Leaves to be a land of perfect pastoral peace by any means necessary. Organized opposition and criminal activity are their #1 enemies, with offenders crucified or burned at the stake.
