# The Site

This website is for my personal 4E world and the games/players shaping it. "Entries" is for notable world info and "Notes" is for play write-ups and goings on. If you want to contribute, this page is about how.

# The Basics

Pages are written using a super simple format called Markdown. If you're unfamiliar with markdown, [here's a link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to a great resource on how to use it. Write up a page about something you're interested in or a note about your character's antics: pass it off to me and I'll get it up with minimal fuss.

# More Advanced

If you know how to use Github on a basic level already or are willing to learn, go to the [repository](https://github.com/EvaKlyn/dregs-site) to check out the file structure of the site. Even at this level, all you have to worry about is editing .md files and getting the changes pushed to main. The site will be generated automatically.

Put entries on the world etc. in ``/entries``. Put notes in ``/notes``. Images can go in ``/assets/img``.
