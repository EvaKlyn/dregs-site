# A Premise

Earth was been driven into the ground, and the solution offered by corporations was the Net. The Net was a network of full-dive VR clients that hijacked all input and output from the brain, and was operated jointly by 5 megacorporations.

There are differing theories as to how and why, but so many minds all connected together created The Dreamer, a being that existed for a single millisecond: in that time reshaped the universe into a grand soup of fantasy and mundanity; raising the collective imagination to the throne of physical reality. It took 10 years for the megacorps to claw their way back, and they've done so with a vengeance.

# A More Coherent Introduction

I like D&D 4E and want to document my and others' experiences with it in this peculiar Very Meta world I've built. I've had a lot of fun running games for myself and a few others in one-on-one format. 

One of the things I like most about tabletop RPGs is the sense of a shared world, and I think many independent agents doing stuff in a world and impacting each other is an incredible way to build that sense so I'm optimizing for it.

Up top are the content headings things exist under. "Entries" is for notable world info and "Notes" is for play write-ups and goings on.

# Other stuff
